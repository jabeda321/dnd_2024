Following the Initiative modifier is an Initiative score. Some creatures that are created by magic lack Hit Dice and Initiative information. <strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Here the monster’s Speed is provided, along with any special speeds. <em>See also</em> “Burrow Speed,” “Climb Speed,” “Fly Speed,” and “Swim Speed.” <strong><em>Ability Scores.</em></strong> A table provides the monster’s ability scores, modifiers, and saving throw modifiers, all of which are detailed in “Playing the Game”. <strong><em>Skills.</em></strong> This entry lists the monster’s skill proficiencies, if any. <em>See also</em> “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”). <strong><em>Resistances and Vulnerabilities.</em></strong> These entries list the monster’s Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any. <em>See also</em> “Resistance” and “Vulnerability.” <strong><em>Immunities.</em></strong> This section lists the monster’s damage and condition Immunities, if any. <em>See also</em> “Immunity.” <strong><em>Gear.</em></strong> If the monster has any equipment that can be given away or retrieved, it’s listed in this entry. <strong><em>Senses.</em></strong> This entry lists the monster’s special senses, such as Darkvision, and its Passive Perception. <em>See also</em> “Passive Perception.” <strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> This entry lists any languages the monster knows. <strong><em>CR.</em></strong> Challenge Rating summarizes the threat a monster poses and is detailed in the Monster Manual. The Experience Points characters receive for defeating a monster and its Proficiency Bonus follow. Some creatures that are created by magic have no CR. <em>See also</em> “Challenge Rating” and “Experience Points.” <strong><em>Traits.</em></strong> The monster’s traits, if any, are features that are active at all times or in certain situations. <strong><em>Actions.</em></strong> The monster can take these actions in addition to those detailed in this glossary. <em>See also</em> “Playing the Game” (“Actions”). <strong><em>Bonus Actions.</em></strong> If the monster has Bonus Action options, they are listed in this section. <strong><em>Reactions.</em></strong> If the monster can take special Reactions, those are listed in this section. <strong><em>Attack Notation.</em></strong> The entry for a monster’s attack starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll’s bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise. <strong><em>Saving Throw Effect Notation.</em></strong> If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect’s entry starts by identifying the kind of saving throw required and then provides the save’s DC, a description of which creatures must make the save, and what happens on a failed or a successful save. <strong><em>Damage Notation.</em></strong> A stat block usually provides both a static number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. The DM determines whether you use the static number or the die expression in parentheses; you don’t use both."
